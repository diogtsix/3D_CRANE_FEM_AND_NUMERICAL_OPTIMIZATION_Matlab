# FEM_3D_CRANE_Matlab
This is a project in Matlab. In this project we: 
- Create 3D Crane with Truss and Beam elements programmaticaly.
- Implement the finite element analysis method (Preprocessor, Solver, Postprocessor) for structural analysis of the structure.
- Visualize stress, strain and displacement distribution
- compare solutions between crane with Truss only and Truss/Beam elements
