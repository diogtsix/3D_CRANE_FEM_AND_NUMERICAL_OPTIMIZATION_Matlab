Crane Finite Element Method (FEM) and Optimization Project
Overview
This repository contains two interrelated projects focused on the structural analysis and optimization of a 3D crane model using Finite Element Method (FEM) and optimization techniques. The first part, the Crane FEM project, involves building a comprehensive simulation environment to analyze the structural behavior of the crane under various load conditions. The second part, the Crane Optimization project, leverages optimization algorithms to enhance the design and performance of the crane structure.

Crane Finite Element Method (FEM) Project
The Crane FEM project is designed to perform detailed structural analysis of a 3D crane. It encompasses the following key components:

Preprocessor: Generates the finite element model of the crane, including node and element matrices. This module defines the geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions of the crane structure.

Solver: Handles the core FEM calculations, such as stiffness matrix formulation, load vector computation, and displacement analysis. The solver integrates with the preprocessor to obtain model definitions and performs linear static analysis to evaluate the structural response.

Postprocessor: Provides visualization and interpretation of the results, including deformation, stress distribution, and potential failure points. It offers various visualization options, including deformed and undeformed structure overlays.

Crane Optimization Project
Building on the FEM project, the Crane Optimization project aims to optimize specific aspects of the crane design, such as material usage and structural efficiency. Key features include:

Material and Geometry Optimization: Utilizes optimization algorithms (like fmincon) to minimize weight while adhering to stress constraints and other design limitations.

User Interface (UI): An interactive UI allows users to select design parameters, element types, and load conditions. The UI simplifies user interaction and enhances the usability of the optimization process.

Automated Testing Suite: Includes a comprehensive set of unit tests for validating the functionality and integrity of the FEM and optimization algorithms. This suite ensures the reliability and accuracy of the simulation and optimization outcomes.
